Happy Eid Mubarak for all muslim brother & sister.

## The Holiday

Eid al-Fitr is one of the most anticipated holiday. It is the largest yearly
exodus in Indonesia, i don't know if this kind of tradition is exist in other
part of the world. By largest, I mean it. More than 30 million going back to
their hometown. It is like moving the entire population of Australia /
Malaysia to another place further than 100 km in the range of 3 - 4 days. It is
good for Big Cities, because it moving their problem, "Humans", to the smaller
cities. The humas also bring, traffic, polution, money, and phones. The fact that
the humans also brings their phones, affected my GSoC availability 😆😆😁.
The reason is simple, the broadband company in smaller city is not capable of
servicing those humans. My 4g provider, "3" is ussualy enough to play youtube
without buffer. Now, it feels like GPRS. The Internet cable is too expensive.
And the installation is not available during the holiday. I should've anticipated
this, by installing it before the holiday begins.

## The end of phase 1

The end of phase 1 is on June, 15. It left me a lot of homework I need to get
done. Thanks to @blazeu, and @jayvdb for giving a lot of advice in my pull
request. I hate it when my pull request is not instantly accepted. But their
reason to not accept it is acceptable. So it is acceptable 😆😆😁. This is a
learning process that all of GSoC student need to do in their GSoC period. This
is why we get paid. To contribute to open source project, and contribute it
properly.

The things I learned from phase 1 is. "You need to empty your cup, in order to
fill it again". Cho says this, one of my favorite character. Without it,
it left me a lot of problem to learn a new concept. You can see in some of my
pull requests, there are more than 100+ comments. It is really shouldn't be that
way. If I accept the suggestion without arguing. Arguing is wasting a lot of
time anyway. Saying "Yes", "Alright", will saves you another hours, than if you
argue. Because, what you know is not always what is correct in all situation.
You are new in the community, and you know little about what they have been
through, to conclude the things they have been agreed for a long time.

So be it. Say "Alright" and save your time.
